"""    Which airport can be worse than Lima International? There is always line in women's bathroom, because each women's bathroom has three toilet stalls and four think. They let you keep water bottle at security, to enter the gate area, but at the gate they have 6 agents who check your carry ones and personal bags and confiscate all liquid, including the bottles of water which we just bought at duty free area. I'm a diabetic and need to drink a lot of water. So I was thirsty all 6 hours of flight. Little cups of water which flight attendants give is not enough. """
"""Despite arriving at the airport three hours early for the first time ever, I almost missed my flight. First, there was a long line to enter, followed by baggage screening. After that, another lengthy line awaited to speak with an immigration officer. Just before boarding, there was yet another line for additional bag checks, as if the machine wasn't enough. Plus, you can't bring drinks or snacks bought outside through security. I didn't even have time for shopping due to the delays. The airport staff was unhelpful when I explained I was about to miss my flight, they asked to wait like everybody else."""
"""  Security was super helpful! As we were passing through security someone stole my wife's Apple Watch from the box after we went through the X-ray. We immediately notice it was missing and reported it. Security checked the cameras and found the thief. Using the image from the cameras they tracked down the passenger and recuperated our watch. All this within 9 minutes. Amazing!"""
"""   Flew both into, and out of, Lima airport. Arrival was a swift process with immigration taking about 15 minutes and then the bags arrived shortly after. Met my driver and it was a v short walk to the car. Departure was also a breeze: quiet LATAM premium check in and then through security and passport control quickly. Staff were friendly and helpful. The Sumaq lounge was pleasant with good options for food and drink. Boarding was on time. I'm sure the airport could do with some modernisation but it worked perfectly for me."""
"""After many years (since 2007 +/-) I frequent this airport I have seen NO improvement. My last visit was on JAN 2023. Why? - Almost no place to sit unless you are in a restaurant - bad choice of restaurants, even if the food is fine in a very few of them - Crampy and not comfortable bathrooms - No airport WiFi - Complicated and lengthy lines at customs (but here there is another responsibility too). In conclusion: it reminds me of a bus station instead of an airport."""
"""   It was an airport official with a drug dog that sniffed me. He needed to search my backpack. I had a carry on and a backpack but he was only interested in the back pack. He opened it and started to empty it, I had smaller bags with things in it that he didn't look at. I the back compartment I had my money belt with money that I didn't wear yet because I was still good my to go through security for a domestic flight. He dove in to the backpack, opened the money belt and took my money into his sleeves. Luckily a face mask got stuck in the zipper so he could only open a small part of it and take some Costa Rican pocket money (was going there after Peru). Terrible that you cannot feel safe at the airport."""
""" It was the worst time lost in an airport queue that I ever experience in my life. It was about two hours to clear customs, a huge queue and just a few employees. I am very hungry now, although I do have money to spend on the airport and I thought I had time for a breaksfast there. But I ended up in a customs queue for two hours. Now I am inside the plane, I needed to run to be on time inside, even though I arrived 3 hours before my flight! You guys need more staff for the number of people in the queue."""
"""I have never had to give an airport review. This one was so bad I felt the need to alert other travelers. I will never come to Peru again as a result of Lima Airport. Over two hours to clear customs entering. Two and a half hours leaving."""
"""  Worst experience within LA. Spent 95 mins to go through immigration. No one could guide us through afterwards and luggage took another 30 mins to come out."""
""" 97 minutes to pass immigration. No one monitoring the line. Complete chaos. I was then sent to wrong luggage carousel. Twice. Officials kept disappearing from their desks at immigration."""
"""  I can't believe this airport was considered best in Latin America. It's so hot in here, it smells badly, it's not clean, there's no good facilities. The line of immigration is always ridiculous and there is no order, the WiFi is terrible. You can't find someone to help. You can't leave it easily because there is no trustable transport and its chaos outside, tourists feel unsafe even inside the airport."""
"""I've traveled all over the world and this is by far the worst airport I've ever been at. Let's say you are traveling from Dallas to Arequipa, via Lima"""
"""I don't ever write airport reviews (or reviews in general for that matter), but I was in transit for 4 hours there and it was four hours too long! I am a model and dietician so I bring my food with me, at any rate you can't drink the water in Lima and there are no purified taps and your only option is buying a $12 USD 1.5 liter Evian water, that's insane. As I said I had my meals so I needed some water as I like to stay hydrated but that price for water was by far the biggest scam I have ever seen in my life! I would bring an empty 1.5 liter next time and have them fill it in the plane if I had a layover. Water is essential for human survival, there is not integrity in leaving people with no options but to scam them with a $12USD bottle of water. I could go on but that is enough for now."""
"""No seats. No outlets. Can't even buy a soda and get a seat at most restaurants to get a seat, need to buy food. So it's obviously a know problem. The airport is bizzarely designed. Getting to a connecting flight is an idiotic process. They don't permit travellers to proceed through the airport to their connecting flight - you have to physically exit the airport and return through another entrance. Getting to security is also over complicated. They have most shops and food BEFORE security. Again, no seats. This airport is far, far too busy. Peru needs another true international Airport to handle its passenger load. Cusco is technically one, but simply flies to Lima 99% of the time. It's smaller, but has staff and facilities appropriate to its load. Lima simply doesn't. The outlets are placed mostly on columns... In the middle of the concourse. So sitting and charging is pretty much a non option. This is, in summary, the worst designed airport I've ever been to, despite its obvious importance."""
"""My transit was International to domestic at Lima airport, so we had to pick up our luggage, go through customs and immigration then re-check in for our flight to Cusco. Apparently most of the people on our flight were connecting, so I can easily say that there was no queue at immigration, and all of our four bags came out first (Star gold). A security guard asked us if we were connecting, and he led us through to the Avianca check in counters. Check in for the next flight was weird. One of the business class counters called over someone from the economy line to check in, and we were next in line at the business line. I was quite cross with Avianca for doing this. Once through, there were a couple of restaurants, and we were quite hungry, so we bought some Chinese food that was reasonably priced at the food court before security. For some reason, my friend's boarding pass did not work and I had already gone through. The agent asked me to pay $12 if I wanted to go back and help him reprint a boarding pass. This seemed like some sort of bribe, and not necessarily a good sign of a country. Security was quite quick, but then at the gate area, there are minimal seats, so most of us were forced to stand. Most of the staff spoke reasonable English and didn't necessarily seem intimidating at all. I don't know if it was because we were tired, but the terminal felt quite hot. One thing I like about this airport is the fact that taxi times are incredibly short here. The landing announcement didn't even finish yet and the seatbelt sign was already off! I think this airport works as an airport, albeit there are some parts it can improve. I think that I'm particularly happy about the short taxi times and would be happy with visiting again."""
"""Extremely expensive, like 20 dollars for a coffee. Extremely rude staff at migrations and security, yelling at people and really bad body language. I found the airport not very clean for the amount of people on it. Also, charging for internet? Seriously? It should be something for free in a place where there is nothing to do, not even shopping because everything was closed for the night."""
"""I had been in this airport six times and none of them was a pleasent one. The airport is very small  it moves a lot of planes  so it gets crowded very fast  the airport is not well signed  they don't anounce the flights  planes are always changing gates  and most of the time  the crew has to be searching for passengers all along the airport. The staff is not helpful. The terminal seating is very uncomfortable (once I was here for 11 hours) bathrooms are insufficient and not clean. Restaurants and stores don't share the wifi  even if you are a customer. Taxi drivers outside are constantly following you  also they take one lane of the entrance so they create traffic inside the airport parking. There is a lot of traffic also in the airport entrance. In general try to avoid this airport."""
"""Lima Airport is the worst airport I have ever been to and here is why. 1) No water fountains because they want you to buy the $2.50 bottle water. 2) Everything is so excessively expensive. 3) The top winner is bathrooms. They are filthy and stinky. It's the way they. Lean them. Horrible! 4) No outlets to charge your devices. You have to use one of the two Samsung charging stations. 5) No free internet (only free 30 minutes), then you have to buy a card for $5 or $10. Lima Airport is the bottom of the barrel."""
"""We have traveled to airports all over the world and Lima airport was certainly one of the very worst we have ever experienced. We flew from Lima to Cusco on a weekend day. The place was completely mobbed with almost no staff providing directions. Complete chaos. The line for security was very long and we barely made it to our gate on time and that was only after pleading with the staff to let us through. On our way back home, we connected in Lima from Juliaca. Despite flying LATAM on both legs of our flight, they were unable to check the baggage through to JFK, our final destination, so we had to retrieve our luggage and check in again. We were told the flight would leave from gate 20. Lots of people were waiting for the flight. Soon before boarding time, they announced the flight would now leave from gate 18, so everyone moved there. Suddenly, the flight time was delayed by an hour with no explanation provided. The gate was change again to gate 21 so everyone moved again. The flight was then delayed another hour without any explanation. Finally, they randomly checked carry ons and told us we could not bring aboard water which we had just purchased from TGI Fridays literally next to the gate. Avoid this airport at all costs."""
"""  We have connected with flights four times (twice in 2011, twice November 2016) and have always had a very easy time. I've read a number of reviews that say this airport is a nightmare, but we have never had an issue. Maybe because we generally went through at night (after 9:00 pm) but we have found the signage easy to follow, and have not had any delays in immigration and customs. There have always been staff to help guide us. Our turnaround times have always been on the shorter side, so we have not tried the restaurants or shops there. The only issue we have had was heavy traffic. Lima is a pretty busy airport to have only one runway. On this trip our flight to Juliaca was delayed about 40 minutes because of the number of planes taking off and landing. But the pilot (LATAM) made up most of the time so we weren't too late."""
"""In my opinion Lima airport is one of the best in South America, they have really improved. I had some problems with an airline and inside the airport there is an office name Indecopi and is open 24/7 they helped me a lot, they will go and speak with the airline involved in the problem and try to resolve your issue. Plus side the food court is one of the best specially Pardos Chicken - a really delightful treat. Security check was speedy and immigration won't take you more than 10 min even on a crowded day. 2 of the largest airlines in South America use this airport as a hub LATAM and Avianca. Only negative side is that internet is very expensive, but you can get 10 minutes for free, good to tell relatives you are alive. Will recommend and definitely will come back using this route."""
"""Very bad experience with Lima Airport, starting with transfer when you have to collect your luggage despite checked luggage to final destination (airport rules, not airline). Very unfriendly staff, foreigners bad treatment comparing to local, no english spoken. And wifi access only for 10 minutes."""
"""Ah, Lima Airport - these folks really need to look at their capacity issues with this single-runway. Thankfully, Lima is located in a warm climate which allows for bus-boarding from the main terminal - however, with the number of passengers they need to look at how to make this airport more suitable for future passenger growth. Make sure to collect your baggage - transiting passengers need to get your bags from carousel and then re-check with your airline in order to make sure your stuff gets to your next destination. Very little seating located at the gates. I ended up parking myself upstairs at their food court (which is actually clean and nice). What I personally don't understand is this - with the ubiquity of technology in South America and everyone having smartphones glued to their ears and hands - install some self service kiosks so passengers can get their boarding passes without waiting. Overall, my experience is that 'Customer Service' is lacking in most of South America."""
"""We started the day in Cuzco, and connected via American Airlines in Lima. We had to change planes from LAN to AA, so we had to leave security and re-check in at the gate. WIth a four hour layover, there was no where to sit, and no agents to check you in. People sat on the floor, and before you knew it, were four-deep against the wall. Security would walk through on occasion, but no one was able to answer questions about when the agents would show up. We had business class tickets, but when the queue finally was set up, there was little to no indication as to where that line started, which resulted in some midwesterners mouthing off to us as we moved into the business class line (probably due to the same frustration we were feeling). About an hour later we finally made it to the front of the business class queue. All in all, I've travelled to more airports than I can count internationally, and this airport was by far the worst. The comments about the water (purchased post-security, pre-flight) are true - they won't let you bring them on the plane. The road traffic to the airport is awful. Give yourself plenty of time and be prepared to mingle with strangers as you wait for the agents to show up and set up the queue locations. Sadly, it was a horrible last memory for a great country to visit and tour. If I never fly through Lima again, it will be too soon."""
"""This airport is excellent I have never seen public bathrooms so clean everyone greets you with a smile and they are so helpful. everything went smoothly. The rental car location is so handy and everyone is there to help you. Looking forward to going back this December."""
"""I think it's got pretty fine features but it's too small for the amount of passengers it handles. Try to have at least 4 hours between int. flights you may require them but if you don't there are plenty of things to do and eat!"""
"""Generally ok. Starbucks variety of cafes and fast food restaurants. But one major annoyance: when we passed security we bought a couple of bottles of water only to be told later on we could not bring them on board the plane! Never heard that before. I have flown from many airports and you can typically not bring water through security but it is ok to bring on board water you buy after having passed security. We and many other passengers were dumbfounded. If this is the policy they should have signs to that effect in the shops."""
"""When I visited Peru this airport was my main hub. I flew in and out of Lima 6 times in a 10 day period including to and from the US. While traveling domestically within Peru everything was relatively uneventful. Lines were not bad and we got to our destinations on time. The final time arriving at that airport in order to depart back to Miami was a challenge to say the least. We got there around 7 or 8 pm for our flight that was departing around 10.30pm. This airport is very small to be an international airport and there were passengers everywhere. Security is a joke. The way my bags were searched was unprofessional. Everyone had to wait on ticket agents. We were still waiting to check our luggage when our travel agent came over to our group and whispered that our group was being divided up to get back to the US. There were only 16 of us in our group so I knew there was a major problem. We got our tickets without complaining and walked to the gate. Got to the gate and was told our flight was delayed. Waited a couple more hours and it was around 1 am. That's when we were told to get on the plane as quickly as possible when our seats were called stow the bag and sit. I must say I saw complete order and compliance and we all got our seats in record time and as soon as our seatbelts were on we were pulling out of the gate. We flew LAN/American by the way and they are fantastic. I've been to international airports worldwide and this one definitely stands out in a negative way."""
"""I have been flying all over the world and consider LIM airport one of the best airports in the world. Although a very busy airport they are very well organised. Quick check in fast immigration and security checks. The airport is kept clean at all times. Baggage handling very quick. Very friendly staff and it's very easy to find your way around the airport. Nice and clean catering facilities shops and superb lounges. I've flown around 30 times from Lima airport up to now."""
"""Not a bad experience with good catering facilities and clean waiting areas. Transited LIM 3 times in the past 2 weeks - I found there to be not too many queues efficient immigration and customs processing not particularly friendly staff but where do you ever find them in airports these days."""
"""This airport looks like any other modern airport but not up to standard. I was told my bags would be checked through from Lima-Miami-New York-Dublin (all the same carrier). When I landed in Miami I saw my bag by chance on the carousel and luckily took it through myself otherwise it would have been left behind. There are only ever 2 toilets each time you go to the bathroom (most airport bathrooms have about 16). We bought 2 expensive bottles of water after security to bring on our long 7 hour flight only to have them removed before we boarded the plane (to Miami).  No liquids  is what they told us even though these were bought in airport departure lounge? They didn't warn us of this before hand at check in or through the first security. That was a waste of time and money."""
"""It's not a good terminal domestic and Int'l counters are mixed facilities are quite fair toilets so so don't have free internet access don't offer drink water spots (have to buy it at around 3-4 dollars/bottle)."""
"""The airport has become a nightmare is just too small for the amount of traffic it gets all day long facilities are clean however way too crowded the food court is too small not enough places to sit down to have your meal. The security check points are the worse so far in South America the security people are rude and exaggerate the rules. Passport control is very small very long lines all day upon return the customs people not only check but they don't respect the law because during flight flight attendants provide you with a list of things that you may bring with you and they take that away with no explanation. Unfortunately I have to come back to Lima for business many times per month."""
"""I am a regular visitor to Lima and only have praise for the airport. Inside the airport facilities shops and restaurants have high service and hygiene standards. Check in security check and immigration control are swift and friendly. All in all a recommendable experience!"""
"""With 6 hours to change planes when travelling from Cuzco (TACA flight) to Geneva via Lima and Amsterdam I thought there would be plenty of time even though TACA would not book my hold luggage through. At first there were no personnel at check-in I looked for a KLM office to get some information but couldn't find one. My flight was at 21.30. I returned to the check-in desks at 16.15 only to find that there were queues filling the zig-zags and spreading out through the airport. My enquiry revealed that these people were waiting for a flight at 19.00 so I went off again. At 17.45 I returned to find that the queues had doubled. After a while an official came along to say that the queue I was in was for Air France (the desks were all marked with both companies). I finally got through to the gate at 20.50 but plenty of other people were still queuing. The plane finally took off an hour late giving the explanation that there was a lack of personnel at the check-in desks. Furthermore I had hoped to upgrade to business class on check-in. When I asked at the desk I was told there were no seats left. This was patently untrue as when I asked again on entering the plane I was given a choice of about 8 seats. The cost of the upgrade was about the same as I had paid for my whole return ticket but by this time I was so exhausted and dehydrated that I accepted it. All this hassle could have been significantly reduced if the airport had provided some written information about what time which desks opened for which flights."""
"""Saturday morning leaving Lima to Buenos Aires we had to endure huge queues: 30 minutes for check-in at TACA counters (despite having already done the web check-in) 30 minutes for the security check 30 minutes for the immigration check. At least there is a decent queue control but several counters at all stages were unoccupied therefore it is simply a matter of having enough staff and officers. So having to wait for a total of 2 hours is absolutely shameful and the frustration is increased by looking at all those signs proclaiming that Lima has been awarded the title of best airport for LatAm for several consecutive years."""
"""The terminal itself isn't overall the most modern that you would expect for a capital city however it has a charm of it's own that means that it is not an un-enjoyable experience. The check-in area is different than most I have ever seen with a lot of people standing around behind the check-in operative handling the baggage. Not sure if there is more manual work done here than in most airports or if it would just usually happen behind the scenes somewhere that said it wasn't slow by any means. The security staff as per the standard of so many airports could do with smiling a little more but are on the whole were friendly and not discourteous at all but could be faster. There is a good enough range of shops and eating places not perhaps as big a selection as you might think from the airport size but certainly they are of good quality throughout."""
"""A real nightmare if you are in international transit through Lima. You still have to go through a security check that can take one hour because of the long lines of people arriving from international flights and just changing planes in Lima. Why is that they have to add this security check if you are only changing planes in the international area? This is totally ridiculous and bothers passengers. There is no logic in adding a security check if you have not entered the country."""
"""We flew through this airport twice on our way to/from Cusco. The airport was clean and pretty efficient. The signage was not the best but there were very helpful employees to guide us. We may have been there at off times (6 am Saturday 9 am Sunday) but lines moved very well. If anyone has a long layover consider the Airport Ramada. It is right across the street - you can walk. This puts many US airports to shame."""
"""As part of a recent trip through South America I used Jorge Chavez airport a number of times both for arriving and leaving Lima and transiting through. Never having been to South America before I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Lima is a modern clean and well run airport. Arriving departing and connecting is a breeze and free wifi is certainly a bonus!"""
"""We landed after a long flight from Madrid in the evening. The airport changed a lot since my last visit modern clean well organized - good toilet facilities. We checked in for Arequipa then everything changed. Nine hours waiting but where? Too short time for a hotel no use of the waiting room at the gate (only the last two hours before the flight - then we could lay down on the chairs). Hanging in the hall on the floor walking a little shopping a little eating a bit - but everybody was friendly and helpful."""
"""You no longer have to pay the departure tax when leaving Peru. Well at least you don't have to come up the money as you are trying to catch your flight like in the past. Just flew out of LIM a couple of days ago and as of Jan 2011 the tax is included in the ticket price. Cuts out the step of having to stop and pay the departure tax. This airport has improved tremendously over the last 10 years I've been flying into and out of Lima."""
"""A rather pleasant airport except that after check-in and standing in line for 5 minutes without warning you get stung with a 31 USD airport tax payable in cash only in either dollars or sols. As I had neither (I had used my last sols to pay for the taxi) I presented them with euros or my credit card and ordered them to choose. Once the line of people behind me became too long they finally accepted the euros. For heaven's sake Peru isn't an American state and why won't they take credit cards when practically all restaurants in Lima take them? Shame really as the rest of the airport is quite pleasant. Immigration and security lines moved smoothly without delays."""
"""As someone who has flown in and out of Lima's Jorge Chavez International Airport every other year for the past nearly three decades I can say that JCIA has improved dramatically. Jetbridges have been installed food and shopping options have increased dramatically the first airport hotel in South America opened and cleanliness and visual aspects have increased. The customs have also gotten much better. Before it took about 1-hr to get through but the last time it took less than 20-minutes. Renting a car at JCIA has also improved dramatically as signage is better (not the best) and the location of the car rental park has moved into a more smarter location (away from the hotel and chaos of the major entrances/exits)."""
"""Jorge Chavez International airport has improves a lot since the last time I travelled. Clean. modern with a lot of services inside the airport. The international gates are well organised. You just get out of migrations and you have a large hallway with all the gates to your right. They have just put new gangways for the first time in Lima so it was a good experience walking to the plane. . The thing I don't like the management of Immigrations they are very slow few people checking the documents."""
"""This airport made me never want to fly to Lima again. Immigration was horrible - there were 7 officers for God knows how many people - I was fortunate enough to be  near  the front of the line - it only took about 30 minutes to get through. By the time I reached the officers I looked back and literally could not see the back of the line - it stretched out through a door and around a corner into another room. After going through immigration and customs I felt like I was in an aquarium: there were probably about 1000 people standing all around - including above - looking down on the arriving passengers. Once outside the pick-up/drop-off area was totally chaotic and traffic barely moved. Unlike other international airports I've been to arrivals and departures were in the same place. A double-driveway or ramp could fairly easily fix the problem. Having flown from Santiago where everything ran incredibly smoothly Lima was a bit of a shock. Finally the cash airport tax is irritating - almost everywhere else it's included in the ticket."""
"""LIM has undergone radical transformations in the last few years and now looks like a modern airport in any part of the world. There are all the amenities a traveler could need (except the fact that only one bank has the monopoly on all ATMs there). Lots of shops and restaurants before going through controls. Inside the passenger only area there are lots of shops but limited food options. A new four-star hotel has just opened right outside the terminal but within the airport complex. There are taxi stands in the luggage collection area (expensive) and as you exit that area. Green Taxi posts fares for the different parts of the city and I usually take them. If your hotel is picking you up someone will stand at the arrivals area with your name on a sign. I would not take a taxi I didn't know or off the street there. Leaving the airport lock your doors make sure your luggage is locked in trunk and keep handbags or other carry-on items you bring into the taxi on the floor under your legs as the aiport is in a sketchy area and sometimes break-and-grab robberies take place (especially since many international flights arrive in the middle of the night). The main fault with this airport is how long it can take to get through Immigration (although I read they were improving the system) and the long lines you sometimes have to pay the airport tax. My feeling is that if they are asking you to pay money for using the airport they should simplify and expediate the process. Last time at LIM I waited 20 minutes to pay my USD 30 airport tax."""
"""LIM has come a long way from what it used to be. Arrival into LIM is quick - you disembark and you walk a shorter distance to get to immigration. Priority luggage is separated in its own section. Several announcements keep you informed about security flight info and transport. Customs is pretty easy you press the button and if green you go - red you put your bags on an x-ray no more extensive searches. Departing LIM was just as easy there are plenty of premium check-in counters. I was able to pay the departure tax at the check-in counter. X-rays are quick and staff polite. The lounge is very modern and comfortable. You will find several restaurants bars duty-free galore and inexpensive prices."""
"""Jorge Chavez International airport has improves a LOT since the last time I travelled. Before Some areas of the airport were often dirty but know they have retiled most of the mezzanine and the first floor. The international gates are very well organised. You just get out of migrations and you have a large hallway with all the gates to your right. It is impossible to get lost. They have just put new gangways for the first time in Lima so it was a good experience walking to the plane. Befor you has to walk to it and when the new terminal was in construction you had to get to the aircraft by bus. Apart from not having a good view of the only runway open to public (people who aren't passengers) the airport is doing very good."""
"""I agree that while most people think US$28+ is a bit expensive most of the airports allow companies to include that tax in the value of the air tickets so you don't notice it. It would be a good idea for the people in LAP to allow such thing. That way you could pay the tax with your credit card along with the ticket and earn some miles. Now regarding the terminal one of the things that I regret is that the jetways are solid. I would have prefer ones with glass walls like some of the ones that they have in GRU. It is quite spectacular that way. I also agree that deplaning in the tarmac was quite faster but what can we say - it is the pace of progress. Last time I was there in February 2005 and there still was some work to do. I am looking forward to my next trip to Lima to check the finished work. At least of this stage. The second stage will mean the construction of a second runway but that will probably be activated by 2008-2009."""
"""Flew into and out of Lima twice 25th March and 30th March. A very modern airport with work still going on. Very clean and well kept tiolets were immaculate and smelt clean too. Spacious and bright lots of comfortable seats overlooking runway. Very professional staff who are keen to help and were extremely polite. Airport tax not a problem although I wasn't expecting it $28 to fly to Rio de Janeiro and $4 to Cuzco. Had to have a yellow fever jab to fly to Rio although not visiting the jungle area. Varig airlines wouldn't let us on without a certificate. Our fault as we thought we didn't need it as we were not going into the jungle area. But the medical centre at the airport was clean and efficient and we were back at Varig's desk within 20 minutes. Check in early! If we were late this could have been a problem. Got searched by customs two men travelling together are a target but staff were thorough and again extremely polite."""
"""The US$ 28.10 departure tax is not so bad relatively speaking. Departure taxes are fairly common at international airports. They're often included in the ticket though and so most people do not realize they're paying them. Any round trip to or from the U.S. will cost you about US$ 50.00 in various taxes and fees totally unrelated to the airfare itself: “Passenger Facility Charge” “US Departure Tax” “Sept 11th Security Fee” “US Immigration Fee” “US Customs Fee” “APHIS Fee” “US Arrival Tax”."""
"""Lima Airport is themost important terminal of my country - nothing compared with European or Asian monster airports - but now with help of Fraport Lima Airport is turning to an airport of International level. Jetways and all infrastructure necessary to handle 7 million of passengers per year this year this airport will make several changes that will make it the most modern in Latin America."""
"""I just flew out of LIM last week and was impressed by how much work is going on to improve this airport. Right now the airport is in major construction mode but I am optimistic that when all the work is completed Lima will be one of the most modern airports on the continent. What I do miss is the restaurant on the mezzanine level where you could sit and watch planes landing and taking off before going through immigration but now there are a number of eating and shopping options and apparently more are forthcoming. It will be very exciting to see how this airport evolves in the coming years."""
"""While LIM does leave something to be desired over the past four years the improvements have been dramatic. I was surprised in just a year how much progress has been made on construction of the new concourse. I will however miss deplaning on the tarmac since passengers exit from the front and the rear of the plane which is much faster. The terminal also has been dramatically improved. I remember the good old bad days when there was only one place to eat or drink up on the mezzanine level and a Dunkin Donuts on the main level. Now there is a whole assortment of dining and shopping options up on the mezzanine. One temporary problem though that the powers-that-be at the airport should have thought of in Aug. 2004 there were no working elevators or escalators between the main floor and the mezzanine. Which meant that for a good part of our layover while waiting for our domestic flight to Trujillo my wife and I had to eat in shifts - one of us had to stay with the large checked luggage on the main floor while the other ate in one of the mezzanine restaurants. I imagine this would also make the mezzanine inaccessible to the handicapped. Also there is a surprising lack of seating on the main floor. The smell that someone complained about is diesel fuel which is used as a cleaning solvent in Peru. The hotel will be a welcome addition. Most of the time our flights to Lima arrive very late and require an overnight stay since there are no more domestic departures that day. We usually book a hotel room in advance in Miraflores (30-45 minutes away) but getting there late at night then getting back to the airport the next day can be a real headache. LIM does have a lot of shortcomings but it's not as if they're not expending a lot of effort to try to make it as nice a facility as in more developed parts of the world. I applaud their effort and look forward to seeing what improvements have been implemented the next year."""
"""I was expecting the worse when passing thru this airport. In all fairness they are trying to modernize it and by the look of the sketches of the proposals it should turn out to be a quite respectable place. In the meantime no airbridges so all passengers deplane on the tarmac. It's thrilling to stand so close to those huge behemoths or even drive next to one but still after a long flight waiting on a bus for everyone to deplane is not my idea of fun. Immigrations is a mess - for some reasons all flights arrive in an hour and a half span. The hall is a temporary one (and it shows) and it gets so overcrowded that sometimes they leave you stranded in the bus waiting until there's enough space in the hall - just to queue. Once queuing the lines are so long that it took me an hour and a half just to go thru. Once you pass customs into the arrivals hall it's throngs of people it feels like the whole town is there - so much people it overflows the terminal hall. Of course you get hit with a wave of hustlers peddlers and just plain greeters - really stressful situation. A brawl broke out amongst taxi drivers just for my business. The cops had to come and my party just fled scared to pieces. Departures are no less friendly. Check in to flights take forever (especially US bound ones) lines are never-ending as well. Airside still in a temp facility feels like a big tent although they've made the shops feel particularly classy. Hope that when they finish the renovations the situation would improve considerably."""
"""I am certain Lima is not the worst capital city international airport in the world - I have just not been to any that are worse. Your arrival is usually late at night and the plane will be parked far from the terminal. You will wait some time while security surrounds the plane a stairway is rolled up (no jetways here) and the standing room only bus arrives to bring you to an international arrival terminal that rivals the one in Port-au-Prince. As other have mentioned the only thing slower than immigration is waiting for your baggage. Customs is the typical Latin American game of russian roulette - you punch a button and a random red or green ligh decides your fate. At least it is usually fast. From there if you have someone meeting you well good luck finding them. Traveling in Peru involves the entire extended family greeting and sending off relatives and there will be literally thousands of people awaiting the arrival of your flight. Watch out for the pick- pockets and unscrupulous taxi drivers if you arrive alone. Departures are just as bad with manual luggage screening before you check-in and and the infamous $28.10 departure tax (try to pay in U.S. Dollars wuth exact change as the exchange rate is horrible). There is no air conditioning in the departure terminal and airlines struggle to set up some semblance of a secure area around the departure gates for secondary screening of all passengers. For these reasons Boeing 757s and 767s are the largest planes that can practically use LIM though LAN Chile uses A-340s for many of their flights (a logistical nightmare). According to the airport website don't expect any relief until at least 2009."""
"""I use this airport 5-10 times a year. People who say this airport is the worst in the world haven't travelled around the 3rd World enough to opine. Sure it isn't Santiago or even Buenos Aires but it is clean safe and the international waiting lounge is pretty good (better than at MIA say). The VIP lounge is also recently re-modeled and features free high-speed internet and a free full- service bar in addition to the snacks soft drinks and beer set out for self-service. Lines for international check-in are a bit chaotic but if you can get into the business-class queue you're in fat city. Otherwise avoid the rush which occurs two to three hours before departure and dissipates fairly rapidly. Arriving at this airport is not the best experience. As mentioned in other reviews there are no elevated walkways to the terminal. Everybody including grandmas in wheelchairs and people lugging babies and strollers must go down the stairs and walk along the tarmac to the terminal. This really sucks because most international flights arrive in the middle of the night. The airlines will help if you ask. If the plane is forced to park really far away they will bus you to the terminal. Immigration officers are generally dour and the lines are long and slow but not as bad as in say India. Don't fret the delay because the baggage takes even longer to appear on the belt. I've had to wait as long as ONE HOUR for my bags to come out. I think they've only got 4-5 handlers for all the flights that come in at the same time. Domestic flights are better in this regard and porters are cheap and readily available. In the middle of the night when the jumbos come in porters are harder to come by. The airport was recently bought by a German consortium and is improving gradually. They need to re-think the egress which inevitably bottlenecks when the meet-and-greeters clash with touts and tourists. The most aggravating thing about this airport is the egregious $28.10 tax that is charged to all departing international passengers. The tax is bad enough (especially when you've got to pay for your whole family). But they've placed an extra tax upon what was for years a $25 tax to arrive at this odd number which requires receiving change in Peruvian coinage right before departure."""
"""I fly through Lima about twice a year. The terminal truly is a dump -- one of the shabbiest international airports in the world. But I hope that renovations do not hurt the underlying efficiencies and service which make Lima one of my favorite airports. The only problems I have ever encounted in Lima were airline specific (American) and they were relatively minor. Check-in and connections have always been for me very efficient. When I arrive in Lima while I am walking from my gate I usually see my suitcase pass me on its way to baggage claim. Non-Spanish speakers may have a few problems at Lima but everyone that I have met there has been friendly and genuinely eager to be of service."""
"""First of all any airport that is undergoing renovations in infrastructure is not going to look pretty and the terminal is not made out of wood - and it's not a dump as some people make it out to be. This airport has improved over the years and it will get better. There are a lot of plans for expansion and improvement and these things take time."""
"""Lima Airport is one of the worst airports I've been to. It doesn't have jetbridges sometimes it smell bad and doesn't have amenities - just 1 restaurant and it is very small if you have to leave arrive or just make a connection into this airport just close your eye."""
